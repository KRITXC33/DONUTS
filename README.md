# Run/Build/Dependencies
* When ready to run any script, download 32x **[here](https://github.com/MeltiDev/DONUTS/blob/main/install/python-3.9.7-embed-win32.zip)**
* For 64x go **[here](https://github.com/MeltiDev/DONUTS/blob/main/install/python-3.9.7-embed-win32-64bit.zip)**
For either one, extract contents and run.

* Open the PYSHELL window, and run code.

If you run correctly, this script:

apples = 3
oranges = 2
apples != oranges
True

box_name = "Milk"
if box_name = "Milk"
print("This is milk")
elif box_name = "Soda"
print("This is soda")
else: 
  print("This is unidentifiable, this may be poison")

test_score = 22
if test_score > 21
print("Good job, you did great!")
elif test_score < 21
print("You did horrible, better go to a SPED class!")
else:
  print("Did you even study??")
  
robux = 1000
if robux > 1000
print("You are a champ!")
elif robux < 1000
print("You are a flatfooted noob!!")
else:
  print("Are you parents really this poor??")
  
vbucks = 2,000
if vbucks > 9,000
print("You're parents ain't poor!")
elif vbucks < 9000
print("Are you just piss poor or what?")

books = 2
games = 99
books != games

will most likely look like random phrases.
